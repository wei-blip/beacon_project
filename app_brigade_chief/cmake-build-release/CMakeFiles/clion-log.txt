warning: UART_CONSOLE (defined at drivers/console/Kconfig:43) was assigned the value 'y' but got the
value 'n'. Check these unsatisfied dependencies: CONSOLE (=n). See
http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/kconfig/CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE.html and/or look up
UART_CONSOLE in the menuconfig/guiconfig interface. The Application Development Primer, Setting
Configuration Values, and Kconfig - Tips and Best Practices sections of the manual might be helpful
too.
